# Unified Communication Latency Benchmark Infrastructure

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive, unified benchmark infrastructure for measuring communication latency in distributed systems across three different communication patterns:

1. **Direct**: `head -> worker -> ack -> head`
2. **Sequential**: `head -> worker1 -> ack -> head -> worker2 -> ack -> head`  
3. **Two-hop**: `head -> worker1 -> worker2 -> ack -> head`

## Architecture

### Components

- **benchmarkHead.cpp**: Unified head node supporting all communication patterns
- **benchmarkWorker.cpp**: Enhanced worker node with optional forwarding capability
- **benchmark.proto**: Protocol definition for variable payloads and fixed acknowledgments
- **run_unified_benchmark.sh**: Automated script for running all patterns
- **simple_analyze.py**: Analysis script for comparing pattern performance

### Key Features

- **Pattern Selection**: Single head node binary supports all three patterns via `--pattern` flag
- **Flexible Worker Configuration**: Workers can operate standalone or with forwarding
- **Consistent Measurement**: Same latency measurement methodology across all patterns
- **Automated Testing**: Shell script handles worker orchestration for each pattern
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Results comparison with overhead analysis

## Usage

### Building

```bash
make unified_benchmark
```

### Running Individual Patterns

```bash
# Direct pattern
./run_unified_benchmark.sh direct 50

# Sequential pattern  
./run_unified_benchmark.sh sequential 50

# Two-hop pattern
./run_unified_benchmark.sh twohop 50

# All patterns
./run_unified_benchmark.sh all 20
```

### Manual Execution

```bash
# Start workers
./build/benchmarkWorker --port 50060 &
./build/benchmarkWorker --port 50061 &

# Run benchmark
./build/benchmarkHead --pattern sequential --workers localhost:50060,localhost:50061 --samples 50

# Two-hop with forwarding
./build/benchmarkWorker --port 50061 &
./build/benchmarkWorker --port 50060 --forward-to localhost:50061 &
./build/benchmarkHead --pattern twohop --workers localhost:50060 --samples 50
```

### Analysis

```bash
python3 simple_analyze.py
```

## Results Summary

Based on our test runs:

| Pattern    | Average Latency | Overhead vs Direct | Communication Style |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Direct     | 0.164 ms       | 0% (baseline)     | Single round-trip |
| Two-hop    | 0.338 ms       | +106.5%          | Forwarded request |
| Sequential | 0.338 ms       | +106.8%          | Two round-trips   |

### Key Insights

1. **Direct pattern** provides the baseline performance (~0.16ms average)
2. **Two-hop pattern** is marginally faster than sequential (0.1% improvement)
3. **Sequential pattern** has highest latency due to two full round-trips
4. **Forwarding efficiency**: Two-hop achieves near-optimal performance for multi-hop communication

## Technical Implementation

### Protocol Definition
- Variable payload sizes (16 bytes to 8KB in 16-byte increments)
- Fixed 512-byte acknowledgments for consistent return traffic
- High-precision nanosecond timestamp capture

### Worker Forwarding
Workers support optional forwarding via `--forward-to` parameter:
```cpp
class ForwardingClient {
    // Forwards requests to next worker in chain
    Status ForwardRequest(const BenchmarkRequest& request, BenchmarkResponse* response);
};
```

### Pattern Logic
Head node implements pattern-specific request handling:
- **Direct**: Single client request
- **Sequential**: Two sequential client requests  
- **Two-hop**: Single request to forwarding worker

### Result Format
CSV output includes pattern identification:
```
PayloadSize,LatencyMs,Success,RequestTimestamp,ResponseTimestamp,Pattern
16,0.198,1,1758517123456789,1758517123654321,direct
```

## Benefits of Unified Infrastructure

1. **Consistency**: Same measurement methodology across all patterns
2. **Maintainability**: Single codebase instead of separate implementations
3. **Comparability**: Identical test conditions enable fair comparison
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new communication patterns
5. **Automation**: Complete pattern testing with single command
